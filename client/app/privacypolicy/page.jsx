At Savana Living, we strive to produce high quality furniture that is durable and can last you a long time. We conduct thorough quality checks at our factory outlet before dispatching any goods for delivery. From our end, we try our very best to give you a product that exceeds your expectations.
<br />
<br />
However, in the unlikely event that a product turns out to be defective, damaged or incorrectly delivered (incorrect style, size, color, quantity, functioning), upon receipt, we encourage you to contact us immediately at savanaliving@gmail.com. We do not accept refund/replacement claims if it has been 15 days since you received the product. Therefore, please open and check the goods when you receive them. 
<br />
<br />
Once you inform us about any issues, our quality control team will evaluate the validity of the issue, and if found to be valid, then initiate either repair of, or a replacement on the same. We will arrange for the pick-up and will replace the older product with a new one. We apologise in advance for any issues you might face, and look forward to helping you replace your items at the earliest.
